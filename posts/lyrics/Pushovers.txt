[Verse]
They said it'd be all over in a sneeze
Cracking jokes to cope without the kicks
But their laughter is a wheeze without the sweets
Law of averages is cruel to the brass
 
[Chorus]
La-la-la la-la-la
They said death is the easy bit oh
La-la-la la-la-la
In our war of attrition effort's a great loss
Oh where did all good interest go?
 
[Verse 2]
Don't waste all surviving spirit on memoirs
Oh that's the happy white way out
The psychic said you'd love my light for your casualty
Oh don't you find that's such a chore?
 
[Chorus]
La-la-la la-la-la
They said death is the easy bit oh
La-la-la la-la-la
In our war of attrition effort's a great loss
Our lovers over
 
[Bridge]
Over and over and over and over
And over and over and over and over
And over and over and over and over
And over and over and over now

[Chorus]
La-la-la la-la-la
They said death is the easy bit oh
La-la-la la-la-la

They said and now immolation's a better deal
