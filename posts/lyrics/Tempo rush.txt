[Verse]  
Life's an arcade with no reset  
Chasing dreams you ain't caught yet  
Blink once life's a silhouette  
Running fast no safety net  
  
[Verse 2]
Tick tock hear the heartbeat race
Time's a hunter give no grace
One step forward no time to waste
Feel the wind upon your face

[Chorus]
Run run run don't slow down
Life's a race in this town

[Bridge]
Every second counts each day
Keep on moving no delay
Grab the moment while you may
Hold on tight don't drift away

[Verse 3]
Through the fog and through the pain
Sun will shine above the rain
Keep on pushing break the chain
Find the speed you can't contain

[Chorus]
Run run run don't slow down
Life's a race in this town
