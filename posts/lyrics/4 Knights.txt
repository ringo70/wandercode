(Verse 1)
Concrete jungle, digital rain
Fortnite's callin', a digital pain
Jonesy's grumblin', "Another day
Of lootin' and shootin', come what may!"

(Chorus)
Rumble in the storm, the circle's tight
Peely's peelin', fearin' the fight
Pump shotgun blasts, a symphony of death
Leavin' nothin' but dust and a final breath

(Verse 2)
Gliders unfoldin', a graceful descent
Landin' soft, adrenaline's intent
Searchin' for chests, a treasure hunt
Hopin' for gold, a golden gun

(Chorus)
Rumble in the storm, the circle's tight
Peely's peelin', fearin' the fight
Pump shotgun blasts, a symphony of death
Leavin' nothin' but dust and a final breath

(Bridge)
Buildin' high, a fortress of wood
But the storm's brewin', misunderstood
Enemies snipin', a constant threat
But this warrior's spirit, ain't broken yet

(Chorus)
Rumble in the storm, the circle's tight
Peely's peelin', fearin' the fight
Pump shotgun blasts, a symphony of death
Leavin' nothin' but dust and a final breath

(Outro)
Victory Royale! The crowd goes wild
Another day survived, in this digital child
Fortnite forever, a battleground's embrace
Leavin' nothin' but shadows, in this digital space
