[Verse]
Days of rain are left behind
In the mirror they unwind
With our kids and future bright
Together we take flight

[Verse 2]
Her eyes shine like morning dew
In the night and sunlight too
Crossing rivers hand in hand
On this journey grand and grand

[Chorus]
Gorgeous lady by my side
Through the storms we always ride
Past the waves and through the sands
With our love we make our plans

[Verse 3]
Footsteps echo in the street
Hear the rhythm of our beat
Laughing as the dawn awakes
Sharing all the joy it takes

[Bridge]
Memories in each embrace
Finding peace in every space
Holding tight and never stray
In her arms I want to stay

[Chorus]
Gorgeous lady by my side
Through the storms we always ride
Past the waves and through the sands
With our love we make our plans
